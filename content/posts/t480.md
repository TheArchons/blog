<!-- anecdote -->
I once owned a sleek, modern, aluminum laptop. It was incredibly thin and light, had a beautiful high-resolution touchscreen, and ran faster than many gaming laptops. Then, in 2024, I sold it, and bought a 6 year old Thinkpad T480 for less than $200. <!-- puzzling statement, to draw the reader in --> No, I was not short on cash or anything. Instead, I genuinely believe that the T480 is a better laptop than the one I had.

# Overview
<!-- Background information -->
The ThinkPad T480 is a Lenovo 14 inch laptop released in 2018. It weighs around 1.6kg, although a larger battery will slightly increase the weight. It is the second-last laptop of the T4xx line, succeeding the ThinkPad T470, and succeeded by the T490.

# Specs
<!--
This is usually done on tech blogs like this, where you list a bunch of technical information.

The only things you really need to know is that this laptop is powerful for the time, but a bit on the slow side now. I also included my upgrades (and upgrade options), because this is important to one of my main points.
-->
There are varying configurations of the T480, but here are the specs of mine:
- Intel Core i5-8350U 4C/8T @3.6GHz (i3 and i7 variants also available)
- 24GB DDR4 (8GB + 16GB Upgrade)
- Internal 24Wh battery + 72Wh hot-swappable external battery
- 1920x1080 14 inch IPS display (Upgradable to 2560x1440 or Touchscreen)
- WD Black SN770 1TB NVMe SSD (Upgraded from a 256GB NVMe SSD)
- NixOS (Linux)
- Ports:
    - Two USB-C ports
    - Two USB 3.1 ports, with one Always On
    - One HDMI 1.4b port
    - Ethernet port
    - 3.5mm headphone jack
    - SD card reader
    - Fingerprint sensor

# Repairability/Sustainability
For me, the biggest benefit of the T480 is it's repairability, and therefore sustainability. <!-- example -->Since this is an old laptop that I bought used, it came with a dead battery, slow SSD, and 8GB of ram. If it weren't for the upgrades I performed on these parts, this laptop would be useless to me, and would have ended up in the landfill. However, for less than $100, and 30 minutes of my time, I had upgraded this laptop to have **more** storage and RAM than I had on my previous device.

# But isn't the CPU too slow??? <!-- I try to address criticisms, and this was one of my largest concerns, and I know many others will be concerned about this as well -->
Surprisingly, for common tasks, it isn't. Web browsing (even 4k youtube) runs perfectly fine, and I have not noticed any slowdowns at all. <!-- since this is tech, I mention programming -->Programming is also perfectly fine, and even IDEs like IntelliJ <!-- relatively hard to run coding software --> run without a hitch. As I am writing this in vscode, my CPU utilization stays around a comfortable 30%.

The only times you may need more compute is when compiling <!-- basically turning human-readable code into a computer program. When it gets to large projects with millions of lines of code, this can take tens of minutes even on high-end computers. -->and playing graphically intensive video games. However, I would argue that laptops would not be the optimal device to do this anyways. For maximum performance, compiling should be delegated to your server instead, and video games should be played on your gaming PC. Even if you ued a "gaming" laptop, the battery would quickly die, and the noise would be extremely distracting. On a gaming PC at home, you can achieve a more comfortable experience at home, and a remote connetion to your server would allow you to compile remotely. Since you can install high-performance Xeons <!-- big and power hungry server CPUs that are built for servers. They run a lot faster than even the best laptops for compiling. --> in these servers, it would be faster than any laptop you can buy.
