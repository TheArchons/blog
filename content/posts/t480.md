<!-- anecdote -->
I once owned a sleek, modern, aluminum laptop. It was incredibly thin and light, had a beautiful high-resolution touchscreen, and ran faster than many gaming laptops. Then, in 2024, I sold it, and bought a 6 year old Thinkpad T480 for less than $200. <!-- puzzling statement, to draw the reader in --> No, I was not short on cash or anything. Instead, I genuinely believe that the T480 is a better laptop than the one I had.

# Overview
<!-- Background information -->
The ThinkPad T480 is a Lenovo 14 inch laptop released in 2018. It weighs around 1.6kg, although a larger battery will slightly increase the weight. It is the second-last laptop of the T4xx line, succeeding the ThinkPad T470, and succeeded by the T490.

# Specs
<!--
This is usually done on tech blogs like this, where you list a bunch of technical information.

The only things you really need to know is that this laptop is powerful for the time, but a bit on the slow side now. I also included my upgrades (and upgrade options), because this is important to one of my main points.
-->
There are varying configurations of the T480, but here are the specs of mine:
- Intel Core i5-8350U 4C/8T @3.6GHz (i3 and i7 variants also available)
- 24GB DDR4 (8GB + 16GB Upgrade)
- Internal 24Wh battery + 72Wh hot-swappable external battery
- 1920x1080 14 inch IPS display (Upgradable to 2560x1440 or Touchscreen)
- WD Black SN770 1TB NVMe SSD (Upgraded from a 256GB NVMe SSD)
- Ports:
    - Two USB-C ports
    - Two USB 3.1 ports, with one Always On
    - One HDMI 1.4b port
    - Ethernet port
    - 3.5mm headphone jack
    - SD card reader
    - Fingerprint sensor

# Price
Since many businesses are replacing their laptops with newer ThinkPads, these T480s are quite cheap. Currently, you can purchase a used T480 for less than $200, especially on Ebay. Alternatively, depending on your location, local second-hand computer stores may offer this model as well.

Additionally, this laptop is cheap enough that you don't need to bother with scratching it. For a MacBook that costs more than $1000, every little scratch can bring down the value, and you feel the need to "baby" it. However, with a cheap laptop, scuffs and scratches are no big deal, especially if you bought it used. Even if anything major breaks, all of the T480's parts are easily replaceable. <!-- transition to repairability -->

# Repairability/Sustainability
For me, the biggest benefit of the T480 is it's repairability, and therefore sustainability. <!-- example -->Since this is an old laptop that I bought used, it came with a dead battery, slow SSD, and 8GB of ram. If it weren't for the upgrades I performed on these parts, this laptop would be useless to me, and would have ended up in the landfill. However, for less than $100, and 30 minutes of my time, I had upgraded this laptop to have more storage and RAM than I had on my previous device.

Lenovo provides everything you would need to repair your laptop. They provide <!-- as per the usual blog style, I cite things by directly linking to them, rather than using proper citations -->[repair manuals](https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/thinkpad-t-series-laptops/thinkpad-t480-type-20l5-20l6/selfrepair/removalsreplacements), [schematics](https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/thinkpad-t-series-laptops/thinkpad-t480-type-20l5-20l6/20l5/parts/display/schematic), and every [part](https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/thinkpad-t-series-laptops/thinkpad-t480-type-20l5-20l6/20l5/parts/display/buy-now) you'd need. <!-- contrasts with macbooks, since they are common amongst programmers --> In contrast, the 2023 MacBook Pro now requires [30 steps](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+14-Inch+Late+2023+(M3+Pro+and+M3+Max)+Battery+Replacement/167647) to replace a battery. Additionally, components like the RAM and SSD are now soldered to the motherboard, making it nearly impossible to replace.

The benefits of repairability is not only to save money, but also for the environment. The life of a MacBook is only limited to a few years, as the battery will inevitably die. Even for a 2017 MacBook pro, repairs would cost around $340. This leads to huge numbers of devices being thrown out after just a few years, whereas you could easily repair ThinkPads to keep them running for decades. Even when the hardware eventually gets too slow for daily use, they can easily be repurposed for other applications, like for running a small server, or a media center device.

# Battery Bridge
One of my favourite features of the T480 is the Battery Bridge. Essentially, the T480 contains an internal battery that keeps the laptop on while the external battery is removed. This lets you swap batteries without needing to shut down the laptop. Theoretically, you can run the laptop forever without plugging it in, as long as you have enough external batteries. Lenovo offers low capacity (24Wh) <!-- a measure of battery capacity. Bigger number = longer runtime -->and high capacity batteries (48Wh, 72Wh). Thus, if you want to carry a lighter laptop with a smaller battery or no external battery at all, or carry higher capacity batteries if you know you won't have access to a power outlet all day.

The T480 provides more than enough port for daily use. On a Macbook Air, you are only given USB-C ports, a headphone jack, and a magsafe port. Even if you just want to plug in a mouse, you have to carry a dongle with you. Apple's argument is that it allows them to make the laptop thinner, but does adding a few millimeters matter? I would argue that having to carry a separate dongle is significantly more annoying than a few millimeters of thickness, since you now have multiple things to keep track of, and it may necessitate bringing a bag, rather than only carrying the laptop. Even if you somehow need more ports on your laptop, I would consider using an Ultra Dock.

# The Ultra Dock

This dock's name is very fitting, since it provides every port you'd ever need need:

- Four - USB 3.1 gen2 (10Gbps) with 1* always-on USB charging
- Two - USB-C ports (10Gbps, 5V 3A power)
- 10/1000 Gigabit Ethernet
- Two DisplayPort 1.4
- HDMI 2.0
- VGA
- Stereo/Mic Combo Audio Port
- DC-IN
- KensingtonÂ® Lock Slot

This dock gives you ports that are equivalent to many desktop computer. In fact, I was able to replace my main computer with the T480 and dock. Additionally, one common complaint about using laptops like this is that it is very annoying to plug everything in/out every time, especially if you have a lot of things connected. For me, it would be incredibly annoying to have to unplug all three of my external monitors, my ethernet, and the plethora of USB devices. With the dock, it only takes a single switch to dock/undock instantly.

# But isn't the CPU too slow???
<!-- I try to address criticisms, and this was one of my largest concerns, so I know many others will be concerned about this as well -->
Surprisingly, for common tasks, it isn't. Web browsing (even 4k youtube) runs perfectly fine, and I have not noticed any slowdowns at all. <!-- since this is tech, I mention programming -->Programming is also perfectly fine, and even IDEs like IntelliJ <!-- relatively hard to run coding software --> run without a hitch. As I am writing this in vscode, my CPU utilization stays around a comfortable 30%.

The only times you may need more compute is when compiling <!-- basically turning human-readable code into a computer program. When it gets to large projects with millions of lines of code, this can take tens of minutes even on high-end computers. -->and playing graphically intensive video games. However, I would argue that laptops would not be the optimal device to do this anyways. For maximum performance, compiling should be delegated to your server instead, and video games should be played on your gaming PC. Even if you ued a "gaming" laptop, the battery would quickly die, and the noise would be extremely distracting. On a gaming PC at home, you can achieve a more comfortable experience at home, and a remote connetion to your server would allow you to compile remotely. Since you can install high-performance Xeons <!-- big and power hungry server CPUs that are built for servers. They run a lot faster than even the best laptops for compiling. --> in these servers, it would be faster than any laptop you can buy.

# Think
<!-- I tried to talk more generally in the paragraph, to signal the end.-->
<!-- prediction-->
Given the regressions current laptops are experiencing, we may never see a laptop with unique and useful features like these again. So, when you are considering your next laptop purchase, *think* about purchasing a T480. *Think* about the planet.
