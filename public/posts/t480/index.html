<!-- anecdote -->
<p>I once owned a $1000 laptop. It was fully aluminum, modern, and sleek. The laptop was thin, the bezels <!-- The border around the actual screen -->were thin, the performance was phenomenal, and the UHD 90hz touchscreen was a pleasure to use. In 2024, I sold it and bought a 6 year old Thinkpad T480 for less than $200. <!-- puzzling statement, to draw the reader in --> No, I was not short on cash or anything. Instead, I genuinely believe that the T480 is a better laptop than the one I had before.</p>
<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<!-- Background information -->
<p>The ThinkPad T480 is a Lenovo 14 inch laptop released in 2018. It weighs around 1.6kg, although a larger battery will slightly increase the weight. It is the second-last laptop of the T4xx line, succeeding the ThinkPad T470, and succeeded by the T490.</p>
<h1 id="specs">Specs</h1>
<!--
This is usually done on tech blogs like this, where you list a bunch of technical information.

The only things you really need to know is that this laptop is powerful for the time, but a bit on the slow side now. I also included my upgrades (and upgrade options), because this is important to one of my main points.
-->
<p>There are varying configurations of the T480, but here are the specs of mine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intel Core i5-8350U 4C/8T @3.6GHz (i3 and i7 variants also available)</li>
<li>24GB DDR4 (8GB + 16GB Upgrade)</li>
<li>Internal 24Wh battery + 72Wh hot-swappable external battery</li>
<li>1920x1080 14 inch IPS display (Upgradable to 2560x1440 or Touchscreen)</li>
<li>WD Black SN770 1TB NVMe SSD (Upgraded from a 256GB NVMe SSD)</li>
<li>Ports:
<ul>
<li>Two USB-C ports</li>
<li>Two USB 3.1 ports, with one Always On</li>
<li>One HDMI 1.4b port</li>
<li>Ethernet port</li>
<li>3.5mm headphone jack</li>
<li>SD card reader</li>
<li>Fingerprint sensor</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="price">Price</h1>
<p>Since many businesses are replacing their laptops with newer ThinkPads, these T480s are quite cheap. Currently, you can purchase a used T480 for less than $200, especially on Ebay. Or, depending on your location, local second-hand computer stores may offer this model as well.</p>
<p>The laptop is so cheap that you don&rsquo;t even need to worry about scratching it. For a MacBook that costs more than $1000, every little scratch can bring down the value, and you feel the need to &ldquo;baby&rdquo; it. However, with a cheap laptop, scuffs and scratches are no big deal, especially if you bought it used and it came with scratches already. Even if anything major breaks, the T480 is one of the most repairable laptops. <!-- transition to repairability --></p>
<h1 id="repairabilitysustainability">Repairability/Sustainability</h1>
<p>For me, the biggest benefit of the T480 is it&rsquo;s repairability, and therefore sustainability. <!-- example -->Since this is a relatively old laptop that I bought second-hand, it came with a dead battery, slow SSD, and 8GB of ram. In that state, it was completely unusable to me. However, in less than a minute, I replaced the removable battery with a new one. Then, with just 30 minutes of my time, I had upgraded this laptop to have more storage and RAM than my $1000 device.</p>
<p>Lenovo provides everything you would need to repair your laptop. They provide <!-- as per the usual blog style, I cite things by directly linking to them, rather than using proper citations --><a href="https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/thinkpad-t-series-laptops/thinkpad-t480-type-20l5-20l6/selfrepair/removalsreplacements">repair manuals</a>, <a href="https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/thinkpad-t-series-laptops/thinkpad-t480-type-20l5-20l6/20l5/parts/display/schematic">schematics</a>, and every <a href="https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/thinkpad-t-series-laptops/thinkpad-t480-type-20l5-20l6/20l5/parts/display/buy-now">part</a> you&rsquo;d need. <!-- contrasts with macbooks, since they are common amongst programmers --> In contrast, the 2023 MacBook Pro now requires <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+14-Inch+Late+2023+(M3+Pro+and+M3+Max)+Battery+Replacement/167647">30 steps</a> just to replace a battery. For reference, the T480&rsquo;s external battery needs just <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Lenovo+ThinkPad+T480+External+Battery+Replacement/139938">2</a>, and the internal battery needs <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Lenovo+ThinkPad+T480+Internal+Battery+Replacement/139942">7</a>. Additionally, many of the MacBook&rsquo;s components (e.g. the RAM and SSD) are now soldered to the motherboard, making it nearly impossible to replace.</p>
<p>The benefits of repairability is not only to save money, but also for the environment. The life of a MacBook is only limited to just a few years, as the battery will inevitably die. Even for a 2017 MacBook pro, a battery replacement would cost around $340. At that price, it is often a better decision to just buy a new laptop. This leads to huge numbers of devices being thrown out after just a few years, whereas you could easily repair ThinkPads to keep them running for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwgvtsrNcy0">decades</a>. Plus, many companies are throwing away these laptops, so by buying a T480, you are saving it from the landfill. A whopping <a href="https://unitar.org/about/news-stories/press/global-e-waste-monitor-2024-electronic-waste-rising-five-times-faster-documented-e-waste-recycling">62 million tones</a> of e-waste was produced in 2022, and it is projected to continue rising. We need to do something about our endless consumerism of electronics before it&rsquo;s too late. Even when the hardware eventually gets too slow for regular use, they can easily be repurposed for other applications, like for running a small server, or a media center device.</p>
<h1 id="battery-bridge">Battery Bridge</h1>
<p>One of my favourite features of the T480 is the Battery Bridge. The T480 contains an internal battery that keeps the laptop on while the external battery is removed. This lets you swap batteries without needing to shut down the laptop. Theoretically, you can run the laptop forever without plugging it in, as long as you have enough external batteries. Lenovo offers low capacity (24Wh) <!-- a measure of battery capacity. Bigger number = longer runtime -->and high capacity batteries (48Wh, 72Wh). The 72Wh battery may be large, but I am getting around 8 hours of use out of a single battery, which rivals the time of the MacBooks. If you want to carry a lighter laptop with a smaller battery or no external battery at all, or carry higher capacity batteries if you know you won&rsquo;t have access to a power outlet all day.</p>

<p>The T480 provides more than enough port for daily use. On a Macbook Air, you are only given USB-C ports, a headphone jack, and a magsafe port. Even if you just want to plug in a mouse, you have to carry a dongle with you. Apple&rsquo;s argument is that it allows them to make the laptop thinner, but does adding a few millimeters really matter? I would argue that having to carry a separate dongle is significantly more annoying than a few millimeters of thickness, since you now have multiple things to keep track of, and it probably means bringing a bag rather than only carrying the laptop. Plus, if you somehow need more ports on your laptop, I would consider using an Ultra Dock.<!-- transition to the Ultra Dock --></p>

    <img src="/img/t480/ultra-dock.JPG"
         alt="A picture of the Ultra Docking Station">
    <figcaption>The Ultra Dock Source: Lenovo</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This dock&rsquo;s name is very fitting, since it provides every port you&rsquo;d ever need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Four - USB 3.1 gen2 (10Gbps) with 1* always-on USB charging</li>
<li>Two - USB-C ports (10Gbps, 5V 3A power)</li>
<li>10/1000 Gigabit Ethernet</li>
<li>Two DisplayPort 1.4</li>
<li>HDMI 2.0</li>
<li>VGA</li>
<li>Stereo/Mic Combo Audio Port</li>
<li>DC-IN</li>
<li>Kensington® Lock Slot</li>
</ul>
<p>This dock gives you ports that are equivalent to many desktop computer. In fact, I was able to replace my main computer with the T480 and dock. Docks also solve the problem of needing to plug in/out your cables every time, especially if you have a lot of things connected. For me, I would have to unplug all three of my external monitors, my ethernet, and the plethora of USB devices. With the dock, it only takes a single switch to dock/undock instantly. You can even lock your laptop to the dock, to prevent theft when you leave your laptop unattended.</p>
<h1 id="but-isnt-the-cpu-too-slow">But isn&rsquo;t the CPU too slow???</h1>
<!-- I try to address criticisms, and this was one of my largest concerns, so I know many others will be concerned about this as well -->
<p>Surprisingly, for common tasks, it isn&rsquo;t. Web browsing (even 4k Youtube) runs perfectly fine, and I have not noticed any slowdowns at all. <!-- since this is tech, I mention programming -->Programming is also plenty fast, and even IDEs like IntelliJ <!-- relatively hard to run coding software --> run without a hitch. As I am writing this in VScode, my CPU utilization stays around a comfortable 30%.</p>
<p>If you want to do something more intense like compiling <!-- basically turning human-readable code into a computer program. When it gets to large projects with millions of lines of code, this can take tens of minutes even on high-end computers. -->the Linux kernel, you can simply delegate that to a remote server, which would have better performance than even gaming PCs, because you would be able to install high performance Xeon/EPYC CPUs.<!-- big and power hungry server CPUs that are built for servers. They run a lot faster than even the best laptops for compiling. --></p>
<p>Similarly, I would argue that gaming should be done on a dedicated gaming tower as well. Gaming laptops not only have poor build quality, lower performance, and worse battery life, but are also louder and bigger as well. You&rsquo;re much better off buying a separate gaming PC at home for video games.</p>

<p>Given the regressions current laptops are experiencing, we may never see a laptop as repairable, unique and versatile like these again. So, when you are considering your next laptop purchase <!-- signals the end -->, <em>think</em> about purchasing a T480. <em>Think</em> about the planet. When purchasing, be sure to consult this <a href="reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/1cq3u2u/the_ultimate_thinkpad_t480_buying_guide/">reddit buying guide</a>.</p>
